# BigQuery
This is a program that calculates the mean and median length of GitHub commit messages.

The program reads Githubâ€™s commit messages from Google BigQuery and then calculate and print mean and median length of commit messages from the data.
The data on BigQuery gets updated every hour and the program adjusts the mean and median values periodically as well to reflect new data.
